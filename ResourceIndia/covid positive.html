      <h3>
        If your symptoms are mild enough that you can recover at home, you
        should:
      </h3>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>
          1. Get plenty of rest. You should isolate yourself at home if you have
          any symptoms of coronavirus, and avoid any strenuous activity whilst
          you are unwell.
        </li>

        />
        <li>2. Stay home. Don't go to work, school, or public places.</li>
        <img src="images/thirdpage2.png" height="120" width="150" />
        <li>
          3. Drink fluids. You lose more water when you're sick. Dehydration can
          make symptoms worse and cause other health problems.
        </li>
        <img src="images/drinking-water.png" height="100" width="150" />
        <li>4. Medications. Take proper medicines prescribed by doctors.</li>
        <img src="images/Vaccine-amico.png" height="150" width="150" />
        <li>
          5. Monitor. If your symptoms get worse, call your doctor right away.
          Don't go to their office without calling first. They might tell you to
          stay home, or they may need to take extra steps to protect staff and
          other patients.
        </li>

      <h3>
        The most important thing to do is to avoid infecting other people,
        especially those who are over 65 or who have other health problems.
      </h3>
      <h4>That means:</h4>
      <img class="page" src="images/thirdpage1.png" height="250" width="300" />
    </div>
    <div class="main">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          Try to stay in one place in your home. Use a separate bedroom and
          bathroom if you can.
        </li>
        <li>Tell others you're sick so they keep their distance.</li>
        <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow.</li>
        <li>Wear a mask over your nose and mouth.</li>
        <li>Wash regularly, especially your hands.</li>
        <li>
          Don't share dishes, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with
          anyone else.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clean and disinfect common surfaces like doorknobs, counters, and
          tabletops.
