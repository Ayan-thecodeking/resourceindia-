    <h2>What to do to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19</h2>
    <div class="one">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to
          reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak.
          Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when
          indoors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The
          appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to
          make masks as effective as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid crowded or indoor settings.</li>
        <li>
          Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
          rub or wash them with soap and water.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
        <li>
          Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you
          cough or sneeze.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are
          regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.
        </li>
        <li>
          A normal blood oxygen level varies between 75 and 100 millimeters of
          mercury (mm Hg). A blood oxygen level below 60 mm Hg is considered low
          and may require oxygen supplementation, depending on a doctorâ€™s
          decision and the individual case.
        </li>

    <h2>What to do if you feel unwell</h2>
    <div class="one">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <b>Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19.</b> The most common
          symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other
          symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include
          loss of taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat, nasal
          congestion, red eyes, diarrhoea, or a skin rash.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >Stay home and self-isolate even if you have minor symptoms such as
            cough, headache, mild fever</b
          >, until you recover. Call your health care provider or hotline for
          advice. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your
          house or have someone near you, wear a medical mask to avoid infecting
          others.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
          attention immediately. Call by telephone first, if you can and follow
          the directions of your local health authority.
